The Impact of AI Assistance on Career Readiness

This project examines the impact of AI tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and GitHub Copilot on career readiness among young adults aged 18–25. Through a survey distributed via online platforms, the study analyzed data on AI usage patterns, skills improvement and weakening, and self-reported career readiness. Exploratory analysis revealed that moderate AI usage enhances skills such as writing and technical abilities while over-reliance diminishes creativity and problem-solving skills. Statistical tests, including the Kruskal-Wallis H test, found significant differences in career readiness based on AI usage frequency. A linear regression model was employed to predict career readiness, achieving an R² score of 0.56, highlighting the nuanced relationship between AI dependence and professional preparedness. The findings emphasize the need for balanced AI use to foster independent skill development.
